                    <h3>Creative Director</h3>
                        
                    <p>Being a Creative Director is engaging work that I find endlessly fulfilling. I enjoy leading teams on branding endeavours and marketing campaigns.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Project Manager</h3>
                    
                    <p>Adaptation is key to 21st century development and Agile is the philosophy that embraces this. Every project faces uncertainty due to budget, time, scope, and team. My experience has shown me that the Scrum methodology of having the whole team involved, regular iterative reviews, and constant innovation, produces a stronger product while mitigating the risk of scope creep and technological debt.</p>
                    
                    <h3>User Experience Designer</h3>
                    
                    <p>My ideal UX process includes these 7 steps: Data Collection (on-site visit preferable) - Personas - Ideation - Scenarios and User Stories - Paper Prototyping - Wireframing - Digital Prototyping. I prefer using Adobe Experience Design, Sketch, and Invision for prototyping.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Graphic Designer</h3>
                        
                    <p>I have fine arts and design training. I am proficent in the Adobe Suite applications; Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Experience Design, Premiere, After Effects, and Audition.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Website Developer</h3>
                        
                    <p>HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Github</p>

                    <p>Your website is there 24/7 and will always represent you. A message that conveys your value is key to creating that connection with a new customer or client. Simple design with solid funtionality will help you succeed.</p>

                    <p>A brand is a living embodiment of how, who, what, why, and where your company exists. Creating a unique look with a trusting message will keep you in people's minds. A brand never rests and will have to evolve in order to keep the public engaged.</p>
                    
                    <h3>User Experience Design</h3>
                    
                    <p>Simple, easy, and familiar is key to design. Listening to your user is important to understanding what your product should be.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Graphics</h3>
                    
                    <p>The mind is built on absractions and graphics are the best way to convey fast infomation in a universal way.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Video Production</h3>
                        
                    <p>Moving image captures our attention faster than anything and the present marketing landscape is preparing for video to be the main form of impressions.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Photography</h3>
                        
                    <p>Clean, high detail imagery is the standard today. The modern consumer is conditioned to recognize low resolution easily.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Project Management</h3>
                        
                    <p>Taking on a new project can be difficult and risky. Having someone to help organize and bring your team together is invaluable to its success.</p>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/nedlearning/nedlearning.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://nedlearning.com">NED Learning Website</a></p>
                            <h2>Challenge</h2>
                            <p>During Startup Weekend, I meet a group looking to bring the Adaptive Learning Model to mainstream education. They wanted to bring it to classrooms in an easy to follow format with an eventual ED-Tech component. </p>
                            <h3>My Roles</h3>
                            <p>Strategy, Creative Director, Brand Lead, UX Designer, Graphic Designer</p>
                            <h2>Solution</h2>
                            <h4>Step 1: Initial discovery</h4>
                            <p>To understand the program we meet with the founder, T. Kieran O’Mahony who had been teaching this model for about five years. Stephen Morrissey and I reviewed the process, results, and future plans that Kieran had set.</p>
                            <h4>Step 2: Branding</h4>
                            <p>I facilitated a branding meetings with the team and we agreed to Neural EDaptive as a working descriptive title referencing Neural, Education, and Adaptation. This branding changed when the NED the character was born and became NED Learning.</p>
                            <h4>Step 3: Tech Decision</h4>
                            <p>Kieran and his backers had originally planned to develop a SaaS offering. As I looked at the plan I felt there was an important testing step missing. A simple paper version would prove our concept and pave the way to a more tech solution.</p>
                            <h4>Step 4: NED Challenge Board</h4>
                            <p>Taking Kieran's process for learning, we developed the Challenge Board. The Challenge Board was both a prototype for development and a physical product for those classes that were unable to have tech in their classrooms.  In a short time we had mapped out Kieran's model in the board and created an easy to follow process for the students and teachers</p>
                            <h4>Step 5: NED Character</h4>
                            <p>We tried a few different designs for NED and settled on leaving facial features off and focused on expressing moods and feelings through body language instead. So far this has been well received and having the viewer project their own feelings on NED makes him much more versatile. </p>
                            <h4>Step 6: Prototype 1</h4>
                            <p>We developed the first prototype and we are now testing it in schools. Here is the digital version.</p>
                            <p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/nedlearning/nedchallengeboard.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </p>
                            <h4>Step 7: NED Notes</h4>
                            <p>We also developed a stylized worksheet form to help guide students and give them an engaging way to record the information they need to gather during the process. It pulls from the same styles as the board to make it a cohesive and easy to follow guide.</p>
                            <h4>Step 8: Testing</h4>
                            <p>WE have tested it in a few schools and have teachers signing up to participate. We intend to get a lot of qualitative observational data to help with prototyping and start a quantitative baseline for some performance metrics down the road.</p>

                            <p>Skybridge came to us with an interesting challenge, they needed branding and a marketing site aimed at attracting small and medium size businesses in the tech sector who are looking for a manufacturing partner.</p>
                            <h3>My Roles</h3>
                            <p>Brand Lead, UX Designer, Graphic Designer, and a Researcher.</p>
                            <h2>Solution</h2>
                            <h4>Step 1: Initial discovery</h4>
                            <p>We started with owner interviews to understand the business, culture, and goals that the company was looking to achieve. This gave us an idea of the vision, passion, and dreams behind their business and we started to understand the company’s identity.</p>
                            <h4>Step 2: Competitive Research</h4>
                            <p>Looking across the market and who was supplying who, how others were represented themselves, how they were finding success. Getting the clients' impressions on these was  helpful in identifying their preferences right away.</p>

                            <h4>Step 3: Brand and Name Research</h4>
                            <p>Next we looked at who was using the name Skybridge and what logo and styling designs to avoid. We also validated the space for using the name Skybridge in that vertical.</p>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/skybridge/skystep3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </p>
                            <h4>Step 4: Potential Clients Research</h4>
                            <p>Then we looked at their ideal clients from the stakeholder interview information about target company size, traction, and type of products. These brands and logos gave us an idea of what branding may have the most impact, and which styles to avoid. We came up with some great examples representing the most upcoming companies that could need Skybridge’s services while comparing them to their current clients.</p>
                            <p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/skybridge/skystep4.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </p>
                            <h4>Step 5: Slogan and Message Research</h4>
                            <p>During all this research we kept track of the taglines and stories that other brands were using. This exploration helped us understand what messages were key for Skybridge. This part of the research was especially important for understanding what the website should display.</p>
                            <h4>Step 6: Font Discovery</h4>
                            <p>Next we dove into the vast sea of fonts that exist to find something unique that resonated with the message we wanted. Modern, edgy, and simple was often our clients’ motto and we definitely agreed for the customers they were targeting. </p>
                            <h4>Step 7: Color Exploration</h4>
                            <p>At this point we started considering what colors would distinguish Skybridge. We gravitated towards blue due to the Skybridge name and blue’s psychological association with trust and knowledge.</p>
                            <h4>Step 8: Logo Creation</h4>
                            <p>In creating a logo we did a series of different designs in order to find a path that spoke to the company’s identity. Use of all the previous research become apparent here as we explored designs that empowered the brand. Using psychology about shapes, angles, and color the first drafts were born.</p>
                            <p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/skybridge/skystep8.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </p>
                            <h4>Step 9: Logo Refinement</h4>
                            <p>Following the initial creation, we presented and received feedback from the clients over the course of meetings both in person and remote. These meetings were key to the finishing process of the logo as many opinions played a part in the final decision. As you can see through the refinement process color choices emerged and stylizing became more refined.</p>
                            <p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/skybridge/skystep9.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </p>
                            <p>In the end, an amazing logo was chosen that stands out in their marketplace. It embodies the messages the client wanted, a history of trust, an easy solution, and a longterm relationship. We felt this was accomplished by using the imagery of a mountain to symbolize history, a transparent stripe to pull it together, a beacon to signify easy solutions, and bridge symbolism to signify a lasting relationship. Together these elements both resonated with the clients and speaks to the NW tech culture that they wanted to attract. </p>
                            <p>
                            <h4>Step 10: UX Discovery</h4>
                            <p>Our strategy was to develop a simple marketing site that quickly informs the user of the value and offerings available with a  straightforward call to action. Was chose a few different templates that had high potential and the client helped pick the most appropriate. The blocks were then arranged to best display the company’s value while grabbing the viewer's interest.</p>
                            <h5>Industry and User Research</h5>
                            <p>In this step we finished the industry research and needed the user’s perspective. Using surveys and previously published articles we discovered some of the prefered layouts for website engagement looking closely at how the users would be engaged in story, process, past work, team, and contact.</p>
                            <h5>Creating User Personas</h5>
                            <p>For this part we created 2 user personas wrapped around the potential client research that we had obtained.</p>
                            <h5>Ideation</h5>
                            <p>Next we did an ideation session looking at the different ways that these personas would interact and identify with the content in the website, the flow, and design.</p>
                            <h5>Scenarios</h5>
                            <p>After sketching out a couple scenarios we checked them against different layouts and calls to action within the website.</p>
                            <h5>Prototyping</h5>
                            <p>We did an AB test with a few users that fit our personas having the website laid out in different flows.</p>
                            <h2>Final Product</h2>
                            <p>At the end of the project we had a unique brand with an engaging website. Our clients were extremely happy and continue to get great customer feedback and responses.</p>

                            <p>Branding and UX Design for an app that facilitates an assessment diagnostic to determine the value of the phone while being simple and easy to use for the customer. This experience is currently frustrating and requires a good amount of time researching on the side of the consumer to get any real return on their device.</p>
                            <h3>My Roles</h3>
                            <p>UX Researcher, UX Assistant, Brand Team Member, and QA Tester</p>
                            <h2>Solution</h2>
                            <h4>Step 1: Initial discovery</h4>
                            <p>First we held stakeholder interviews with company owners, product designers, and developers to understand what their goals and pain points were with their product. The goal was to be the prefered avenue for the sale of used smartphones. Their market edge is the ability to better assess what a user’s phone is worth. Their secret sauce was the self diagnostic software. Their main pain point was creating an app that was thorough in its assessment of phone value while being simple and easy for the user to complete.</p> 
                            <p>After this step we discovered that the task of selling one’s phone is often viewed as frustrating and pointless, due to the return, and that the experience needed to provide an avenue of transformation in the user through stages of realization. Curious > Installed > Transactional > Evangelist.</p>
                            <h4>Step 2: Creating Personas</h4>
                            <p>Next the research team pulled some of the main requirements together to get a good view of the target users. This took researching price points and assessing interest due to time and income. In the end we defined 3 robust personas that helped guide use through the rest of the process. Below are the personas we discovered and an example of the continued content under each.</p>
                            <p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/truetap/truestep2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/truetap/truestep2.1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </p>
                            <h4>Step 3: User Interviews and Data Collection</h4>
                            <p>Once we better defined our users we did surveys and interviews with our target demographic. This investigation was framed towards the present process of selling one’s phone. After a series of 12 interviews we had a good set of data to analyze. Upon analysis we soon discovered the pain points and presented our client with an infographic.</p>
                            <p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/truetap/truestep3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </p>
                            <h4>Step 4: Requirement and Feature Validation</h4>
                            <p>During our interviews and analysis, we also defined all the requirements and went through the process of validation with the stakeholders.</p>
                            <h4>Step 5: UX Design and Branding</h4>
                            <p>In this step we paralleled UX Design and Branding. The UX team worked on wireframing while the Branding team worked on name and logo.</p> 
                            <p>The Branding team used the previous research and personas to brainstorm a list of words that identified with the user, company, values, and processes involved. We then went through various exercises to narrow these down to a solid set of 3 which were: True Coin, Gravy, and Copper. After a meeting with the clients and some stakeholders there was high interest in True Coin, which eventually led us to True Tap.</p>
                            <p>During this time the UX team built out wireframes and then a prototype.</p>

                            <p>Produce a commercial for EpicMeet that appeals to its key demographic using a limited budget for live action video.</p>
                            <h3>My Roles</h3>
                            <p>Producer, Director, Editor, and Script Writer</p>
                            <h2>Solution</h2>
                            <h4>Step 1: Ideation</h4>
                            <p>Taking research done from branding and UX work done previously with this client we did an ideation session with our writing team. We made sure to identify the values of the App and the emotional tie users would have to the process.</p> 
                            <h4>Step 2: Scripting</h4>
                            <p>Our writers took those ideas and came back with a couple one page scripts. From these we decided which script had the most emotional impact while conveying the best message.</p>
                            <h4>Step 3: Storyboarding</h4>
                            <p>With the chosen script I made a storyboard addressing the change of scenes, camera angles, and cadence.</p>
                            <h4>Step 4: Hiring and Location Scouting</h4>
                            <p>After defining all the roles that would be needed and considering what the budget could support; I interviewed and hired the cinematographer, sound engineer, actors, makeup artist, and video editor. We looked at several locations and picked one that fit our needs perfectly.</p>
                            <h4>Step 5: Pre-Production</h4>
                            <p>Defining our characters, their costume, and physical needs I researched and purchased our production assets. I tasked my cinematographer with picking and renting the lenses and lights that he prefered. I negotiated the times needed for the location and set the rest up. I also worked with the cinematographer to create a shot/scene list which we ended up using to the letter. I planned a one day shoot over an 10 hour period.</p>
                            <h4>Step 6: Production and Directing</h4>
                            <p>Production day went smooth and we were able to get every shot we wanted. Timing worked out great and no one was in a rush at any moment. I prefer this for my actors and employees, stress destroys concentration and innovative thinking. While directing I use a method that entails empathy and mimicry to help actors ease into their roles. At the end of the day we had every shot we wanted and extra footage for fill.</p>
                            <h4>Step 7: Post-Production</h4>
                            <p>In post I met with my editor a couple times a week and made sure everything was on track and on time. We had meetings over sound, music, effects, and filters. In the end I was pleased with his work. I also finalized budget costs and facilitated payroll.</p>
                            <h4>Step 8: Launch</h4>
                            <p>At launch we added it in our marketing website.</p>

                            <h4>Step 1: Initial discovery</h4>
                            <p>We worked with the client to discover their goals for this product. Working backwards we defined all the requirements that needed to be met.</p>
                            <h4>Step 2: User Stories</h4>
                            <p>Working directly with the client we created user stories. From these we created our feature list.</p>
                            <h4>Step 3: UX Design</h4>
                            <p>I created a clean and simple interface for interacting with the privacy suite. The goal was to make a clear indication of the tasks that needed to be performed and the urgency of current incidents. I used Adobe Illustrator to create mockups for structure and styling.</p>
                            <h4>Step 4: Implementation</h4>
                            <p>I worked directly with the developers to make sure our features worked and the user experience flowed, we finished the project on time with our full feature list.</p>
                            <h4>Step 5: Sunset Reviews</h4>
                            <p>After the project, we had a review both internally and with the client to go over the process and looked at ways to increase our productivity and increase communication.</p>
